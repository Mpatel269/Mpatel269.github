            <h3>SVOC:</h3>
                <p>SVOC is a student reserach conference that occurs annually in the summer semester. Students have the opportunity each year to partake in a research project under the supervision of Faculty staff of various departments. Participation in the conference (includes: submitting an abstract before the conference and presenting at the reserach conference) verifies the student for an Elective subject credit (1) and a 4,000Kc Scholarship.</p>

            <h3>Alternative routes into research:</h3>
                <p>SVOC is not the only route into research at LF UPOL. Many of the staff at the Medical and Dental faculty would gladly welcome student participation in research. If there is an area of research that you are interested in, contact the relevant staff member through your UPOL email and ask them if there is any way that you would be able to aid in research.</p>
