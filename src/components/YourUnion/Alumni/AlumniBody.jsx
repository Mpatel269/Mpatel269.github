                        Our Alumni group serves as your lifelong contact with PEPA and UPOL. Membership is free and automatic upon graduation for new students. If you reached Alumnus status before 2021, please reach out to us and we'll help you get registered and answer any questions you may have about the process. The Alumni program aims to allow for our past and current students to stay connected with eachother and to participate in social and educational opportunities.
